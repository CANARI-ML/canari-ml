# Introduction

This section shows you how to go all the way from downloading source data to plotting prediction results step-by-step. There are sub-sections that are more descriptive and meant to show you the different configurable options you might want to change rather than to be followed as is.

If you would like to follow along with this section, follow the "Config file usage" rather than the "CLI usage" (this shows different options rather than a way to follow along).
