# Training Models

## Overview

This section guides you through using the `canari_ml train` command to train the default `UNet` model using [preprocessed](../preprocess/index.md) ERA5 data. Similar to previous sections, you can override default settings using CLI arguments or YAML configuration files.

The training process involves:

1. Using preprocessed training datasets generated by `canari_ml preprocess train` (Refer to the [preprocess](../preprocess/index.md) page).
2. Configuring model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation metrics.
3. Running the training loop with options for monitoring and early stopping.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Preprocess your ERA5 data following the steps in [preprocess](../preprocess/index.md) specifically for training.
- The training command assumes that your preprocessing has generated a Zarr-formatted dataset and corresponding JSON config file, ready for training.

---

## Usage

The `canari_ml train` command is used to train models using preprocessed ERA5 data. The command supports both direct execution and overrides via CLI arguments or custom YAML config files, or both.

### Basic Usage

To see all available configuration options, run:

``` console exec="on" source="tabbed-left" result="ansi" tabs="Command|Output"
$ canari_ml train --help
```

This will display the default configuration and all modifiable parameters.

## Next Steps

After training your model, you can:

1. Evaluate its performance using validation metrics.
2. Generate [predictions](../predict/index.md) using the trained model.
